# Active Context

**Current focus:**

- Add and refine contributor-facing docs (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`).
- Provide a small concrete example (TASK001) showing how to add a runtime uniform (`uTime`) that agents can follow.

**Recent changes:** Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `AGENTS.md` to guide agents.

**Next steps:**
1. Implement the `uTime` uniform example in a branch and include a demo GIF.
2. Add a small UI example or debug shader output to visualize neighbor counts.
3. Consider adding a basic cross-browser WebGL feature check and a short dev test/process for shaders.
