# Project Brief

**Name:** gpu-conway-life
**Purpose:** Minimal React + TypeScript + Vite demo that runs a GPU-accelerated Game of Life using Three.js / @react-three/fiber and GLSL shaders.

**Goals:**
- Demonstrate shader-based cellular automata running on the GPU via FBO ping-pong.
- Provide a small, easy-to-understand codebase for learning and extension.
- Keep edits small and testable (visual diffs preferred).

**Audience:** Maintainers, contributors, automated agents.

**Success criteria:** Runs in modern browsers (WebGL2 required for float textures), clear shader and rendering patterns, and concise developer instructions for making small visual changes.
